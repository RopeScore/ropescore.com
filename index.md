RopeScore is based on the [FISAC-IRSF](https://fisac-irsf.org)
rules, it allows you to arrange a competition where **you** have the
power. You can add and remove participants on the fly, combine competition
categories, display live scores on a projector, import and exort
participant lists from excel or alike, export the results to excel,
and much more.

RopeScore is further configureable with as many categories, judges or
participants you want, you can also add whichever events you want to a
competition category. In other words you aren't limited by standard choices.

RopeScore comes in a standard version that only abides the FISAC-IRSF rules,
there's also an option for a custom version that in addition may have
customizations such as different event names and abbreviations or, a
simplified ruleset. If you want to get a hold of a standard or custom version
get in touch by emailing me at [contact@ropescore.com](mailto:contact@ropescore.com)
