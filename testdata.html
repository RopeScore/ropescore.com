  With a scoring system the stakes are often high, and you need to know that the
  results are accurate. RopeScore pioneered providing public data for testing when
  we published test data for FISAC-IRSF's 2017-2018 ruleset containing a teams
  competition with 12 competing teams, a masters competiton with 12 competing skippers and
  a triple under competition with 14 competing skippers.
</p>

<p class="w-full leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
  Providing all this data makes RopeScore more transparent, anyone can check that
  the system does what it is supposed to do, and other scoring systems can confirm
  their accuracy with this data as well.
</p>

  All our test data is published under a

<p class="w-full leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
  The test data is meant to cover the edge cases in the rules that could be
  interpreted in multiple ways. And provide the data in a way that can be entered
  into any scoring system and return the same results. We are committed to creating
  new test data for more rulesets that RopeScore support.
