  RopeScore is a capable scoring system that is built to
  handle both from the smallest competition all the way up
  to a national championship.
</p>

<p class="w-full leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
  RopeScore knows that the reality of a competition is messy,
  and it gives you the tools to deal with that. Add or remove
  judges and participants during the event, mark the athletes
  who don't compete in certain events and have as many or as
  few judges as you need.
</p>

<p class="w-full leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
  RopeScores supports a wide variety of rulesets, both international
  and national variations. Originally RopeScore was designed for
  FISAC-IRSF rules, but with the introduction of IJRU we re-designed
  RopeScore from scratch to support an unlimited amount of rulesets.
</p>

<p class="w-full leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
  On top of this, RopeScore greatly reduces the need for paper, using our
  Judging App your judges can score the entry on their phone or tablet,
  and it'll automatically flow into the system. During Speed events you also
  have the option of using RopeScore Live, display the live speed counts
  and engage the audience!
</p>

<p class="w-full leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">
  Oh, and did we mention that our result tables are best in class?
  Providing great clarity and a layout that allows you to quickly find
  the score you are looking for in a way that's unmatched in the market!
